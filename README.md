Title: Response of a four floors frame to the Tolmezzo earthquake using
linear interpolation 

Content: MDOF analysis and linear interpolation of results

This code is developed based on the inputs of the Tolmezzo earthquake 
ground acceleration from Pr. Pierino Lestuzzi course CIVIL420. The file Tolm.txt
must be downloaded and put in the same folder as the code in order to run. Any 
other earthquake acceleration file, written similarly to Tolm.txt can be used to 
estimate the response of the frame to that earthquake. 

This code uses the simplification that the response of a MDOF can be
appoximated by taking into account only the first mode of vibration of the
system
