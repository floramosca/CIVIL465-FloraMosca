Title: Response of a four floors frame to the Tolmezzo earthquake using
linear interpolation 
Content: MDOF analysis and linear interpolation of results
This code is developed based on the inputs of the Tolmezzo earthquake 
ground acceleration from Pr. Pierino Lestuzzi lecture CIVIL420 
This code uses the simplification that the response of a MDOF can be
appoximated by taking into account only the first mode of vibration of the
system
